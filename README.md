Movie Fight!

This JavaScript application prompts a user to search for 2 different movies. 

Once the user chooses 2 movies, the app fetches data from an API to make a comparison of the 2 choices.

A big focus of this application was to make as much of the code reusable, so pieces can be used seamlessly in other projects too.



Bulma CSS Framework was utilized for styling purposes. Movie-fight can easily be refactored to make comparisons of anything!
